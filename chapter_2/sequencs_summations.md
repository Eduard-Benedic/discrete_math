# Sequences and Summations

A sequence is a discrete structure used to represent an ordered list.

## Definition 1
A sequence is a function from a subset of the set of integers to a set S. 

## Definition 2
A geometric progression is a sequence of the form
a, ar, ar^2, ..., ar^n, ...
where
a - initial term
r - common ratio 
are real numbers.

## Definition 3
An arithmetic progression is a sequence of the form
a, a + d,a + 2d,... , a + nd, . . .
where the **initial term** a and the **common difference** d are real numbers


## Recurrence relations
A different way of defining a sequence. each member of a sequence is in a relation with the previous one.

The **initial conditions** for a recursively defined sequence specify the terms that precede the first term where the recurrence relation takes effect. 

### The Fibonacci sequence
*fn* = *fn-1* + *fn-2*
