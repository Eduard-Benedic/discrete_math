# Functions 

## Def 1 
Let A and B be nonempty sets. A function f from A to B is an assignment of exactly one element of B to each element of A. We write f (a) = b if b is the unique element of B assigned by the function f to the element a of A. If f is a function from A to B, we write f : A → B.
Functions are sometimes also called **mappings** or **transformations**.

## Def 2
If *f* is a function from A to B, I say that the A is the **domain** and B is the **codomain** of *f*.
If f(a) = b, b is the image of a and a is the preimage of b.
The *range* or *image* of f is the set of all images of elements of A. 
If *f* is a function from A to B I say that *f* maps A to B.

## Def 3
Let f1 and f2 be functions from A to R. Then f1 + f2 and f1f2 are also functions from A to R defined for all x ∈ A by
(f1 + f2)(x) = f1(x) + f2(x),
(f1f2)(x) = f1(x)f2(x).

## Def 4
Let f be a function from A to B and let S be a subset of A. The image of S under the function f is the subset of B that consists of the images of the elements of S. We denote the image of S by f (S), so
f (S) = {t | ∃s ∈S (t = f (s))}.
We also use the shorthand {f (s) | s ∈ S} to denote this set.

Remark: The notation f (S) for the image of the set S under the function f is potentially ambiguous. Here, f (S) denotes a set, and not the value of the function f for the set S.


**One-to-One and Onto Functions - AKA Injunction**
Functions that never assign the same value to two different domain elements.
These function sare said to be one-to-one
Note that a function f is one-to-one if and only if f (a) = f (b) whenever a = b.

## Def 6
A function f whose domain and codomain are subsets of the set of real numbers is called increasing if f (x) ≤ f (y), and strictly increasing if f (x) < f (y), whenever x < y and x and y are in the domain of f. Similarly, f is called decreasing if f (x) ≥ f (y), and strictly decreasing if f (x) > f (y), whenever x < y and x and y are in the domain of f. (The word strictly in this definition indicates a strict inequality.)


## Def 7
A function f from A to B is called onto or **Surjection** if and only if for every element b ∈ B there is an element a ∈ A with f(a) = b.


## Onto or surjection

## One to one correspondence - Bijection


If a function is a one-to-one coreespondence (bijection) when can define an inverse function.
If a function is bijection then the function is **invertible**git
