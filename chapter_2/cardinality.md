# Cardinality of Sets

## Def 1
The sets A and B have the same cardinality if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence from A to B. When A and B have the same cardinality, we write |A|=|B|.

## Def 2
If there is a one-to-one function from A to B, the cardinality of A is less than or the same as the cardinality of B and we write |A|≤|B|. Moreover, when |A|≤|B| and A and B have different cardinality, we say that the cardinality of A is less than the cardinality of B and we write |A| < |B|.
