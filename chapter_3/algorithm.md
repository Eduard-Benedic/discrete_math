# Algorithms

## Def 1
An algorithm is a finite sequence of precis instructions for performing a computation or for solving a problem.

An algorithm should have the following characteristics:
1. Input
2. Ouput
3. Definiteness
4. Correctness
5. Finiteness
6. Effectiveness
7. Generality

## Searching algorithms

### The Linear Search (Sequential search)
The linear seach as the name suggests perform a search from one term to another in a sequencial order.

### The Binary Search
The binary search is used when the list has terms occurring in order of increasing size.
