# Algorithms

## Def 1
An algorithm is a finite sequence of precis instructions for performing a computation or for solving a problem.

An algorithm should have the following characteristics:
1. Input
2. Ouput
3. Definiteness
4. Correctness
5. Finiteness
6. Effectiveness
7. Generality

## Searching algorithms

### The Linear Search (Sequential search)
The linear seach as the name suggests perform a search from one term to another in a sequencial order.

### The Binary Search
The binary search is used when the list has terms occurring in order of increasing size.


## Sorting

1. Bubble Sort
In a bubble sort your perform for each item a comparison with the adjacent item. If the adjacent item is greater switch places else continue with the next element.

2. Insertion Sort

## Greedy Algorithms
Greedy algorithm is an algorithm that seems to make the best choice at each step. 
An algorithm is "greedy" whether or not finds an optimal solution.

## The Halting Problem


## The Growth of Functions

### Big-O Notation
Let f and g be functions from the set of integers or the set of real numbers to the set of real numbers. We say that f (x) is O(g(x)) if there are constants C and k such that:

    |f (x)| ≤ C * |g(x)| 
    whenever x>k. [This is read as “f (x) is big-oh of g(x).”]

C,k - witnesses
