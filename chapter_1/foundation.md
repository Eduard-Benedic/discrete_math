## Propositions
Propositions - building block of logic
A proposition is a declarative sentence (that declares a fact) that is either true or false but not both.

**Compound propositions** - are propositions formed from existing propositions using logical operators
Truth value - is the value of a proposition and it can be either True (T) or False(F)
Don't be misled by the fact that truth resemble true. The truth value is what that value actually is.


Connective - a term given to these operators
**conjunction** - p ∧ q - it is the equivalend of the and operator where p, q are propositions
The 
**disjunction** - p ∨ q -  eq to *or* operator
Disjunction can be exclusive (p ⊕ q) or inclusive
p ⊕ q - means that if both are True or False you will get a False

Exclusive disjunction - It is True only when one of our propositions p, q is True and the other False but not when both are True.

## Conditional Statements

p -> q implies if *p* then *q*
p  - hypothesis (antecedent or premise)
q  - conclusion (or consequence)
A conditional statement it is also called a **implication**

## Converse, Contrapositive and Inverse
q -> p (**converse** of p->q)
¬q → ¬p  (**contrapositive**)
¬p → ¬q (**inverse**)

When two compund propositions have the same value I call them **equivalently** so that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are **equivalent**


## Biconditinals statement  p ↔ q
Is the proposition "p if and only if q"
The biconditional statement is true when p and q have the same truth values, and is false otherwiser.
Are also called **bi-implications**
T - T = T
F - F = T
T - F = F
F - T = F


So far we have 4 important logical connectives:
1. Conjunctions
2. Disjunctions
3. Conditional statements
4. Biconditional statements
 as well as negations

## Propositional Equivalences

### Introduction
Methods that produce propositions with the same truth value

**Tautology** - A compound proposition that is always true no matter what the truth values of the propositional variables that occur in it
